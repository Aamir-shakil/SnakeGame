# 🐍 Snake Game in C# Console

A classic Snake game implemented in C# using the console window. Use the arrow keys to control the snake, eat the apple (`@`), and grow your tail. Avoid crashing into the walls or yourself!

## 🎮 Features

- Simple console-based gameplay
- Snake grows with each apple eaten
- Wall and self-collision detection
- Score tracking and reset on game over
- Random apple spawning

## 🧠 How It Works

- The snake is represented by a list of coordinates (`snakeBody`) and a moving head (`snakePosition`).
- The apple is placed at a random position within the grid.
- Arrow key inputs update the snake’s direction.
- If the snake eats the apple, the tail grows and the score increases.
- Colliding with a wall or the snake's own body resets the game.
